- Please add option to select sex of a friend male/female and display it
- Please add tests using your preferred testing tool (jest, mocha, should.js ...)

## Objectives

- You have received a working example so please do not upgrade any packages unless you really have to.
- Please check for small things like syntax errors, since details matter.
- Please deliver something that works, non working project is an automatic disqualification

## Feedback on application

- I have implemented selecting gender but still you have to click enter button to add a friend, since this was the existing behaviour and thought should not change by introducing add button.
- After adding a new friend, there is no message displayed to the user saying it has been added successfully, here also same reason as above, i left it with the existing behavior.
